# How to Update Your Tomtom Carminat Live with the Latest Map and Navcore
 
If you have a Tomtom Carminat Live navigation system in your Renault car, you might be wondering how to update it with the latest map and navcore. The map is the database of roads, points of interest, speed cameras and other information that helps you navigate. The navcore is the software that runs the system and provides features and functions.

Updating your Tomtom Carminat Live can improve your navigation experience, as you can benefit from the latest road changes, new destinations and speed camera alerts. It can also fix some issues that might affect your GPS signal or performance.
 
However, updating your Tomtom Carminat Live is not as easy as it sounds. You need to find a compatible map and navcore version, download them, copy them to an SD card, activate them and install them on your device. And you need to do this without breaking any laws or damaging your system.
 
That's why some people look for a crack that can bypass the activation process and allow them to use any map and navcore they want. One of the most popular cracks is the Simba crack, which works with the navcore version 9844. This crack can enable you to use any map from Tomtom or other sources, such as Europe 10.45 or 10.25.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use the Simba crack to update your Tomtom Carminat Live with the latest map and navcore. We will also provide you with some tips and warnings to avoid any problems or risks.
  
## What You Need
 
Before you start, you need to prepare some things:
 
- A Tomtom Carminat Live device in your Renault car
- An SD card reader for your computer
- A FAT32 formatted SD card with at least 8 GB of space
- A backup of your original SD card that came with your device (optional but recommended)
- A download link for the Simba crack (you can find it on some forums or websites)
- A download link for the navcore version 9844 (you can find it on some forums or websites)
- A download link for the map of your choice (you can find it on some forums or websites)
- A computer with an antivirus software disabled (the crack might be detected as a virus)

## How to Update Your Tomtom Carminat Live
 
Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the content of the navcore folder from the Simba crack to the root of your SD card.
2. Copy the map folder of your choice to the root of your SD card.
3. Start your car and insert the SD card into your Tomtom Carminat Live device.
4. Wait for an error message that says "You cannot use this map on this device: Europe..." or something similar.
5. Eject the SD card from your device and insert it into your computer.
6. Look for a folder named LOOPDIR on your SD card. It contains a unique fingerprint of your device.
7. Open the file ext3\_loopback with Notepad or another text editor.
8. Search for "uniqueID" (without quotes) and write down the 10-digit code that follows it. This is your device's unique ID.
9. Close the file without saving it.
10. Open the file ttgo.bif with Notepad or another text editor.
11. Replace the DeviceUniqueID number with your device's unique ID (without spaces).
12. Save and close the file.
13. Run A\_F\_Activate.exe from the Simba crack folder and select: Update meta, Patch maps, voices..., Patch navcore.
14. If everything goes well, you should see a .dct OK message under Complete Map(s) section.
15. Quit A\_F\_Activate.exe
16. Open the Voice folder on your SD card and delete all three .dct files that were created by the activation process. If you don't do this, those voice files won't work.
