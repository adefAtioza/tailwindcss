Cherish was formed in 2001 by the King sisters: Farrah, Neosha, Felisha, and Fallon. They started singing at a young age and were inspired by their father, who was a member of the 1970s R&B group The Internationals. They signed with Warner Bros. Records in 2003 and released their first single, "Miss P.", which was featured on the soundtrack of *The Powerpuff Girls Movie*.
 
However, their breakthrough came in 2006 when they collaborated with producer Jazze Pha and rapper Sean Paul of YoungBloodZ on "Do It to It", which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 15 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song also received positive reviews from critics, who praised its catchy chorus and danceable beat. The song was followed by the release of their debut album, *Unappreciated*, which debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart and number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album sold over 500,000 copies in the United States and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
 
The album's second single, "Unappreciated", was also a success, reaching number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song was praised for its emotional lyrics and vocal delivery, as well as its relatable message of feeling unappreciated in a relationship. The song's music video, directed by Benny Boom, featured the group performing in various settings, such as a bedroom, a diner, and a rooftop.
