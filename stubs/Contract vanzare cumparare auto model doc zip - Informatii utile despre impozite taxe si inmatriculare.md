## How to Fill Out a Contract for Buying and Selling a Car in Romania
 
Once you have downloaded the contract model, you need to fill it out with the details of the seller and the buyer, as well as the car. You can do this on your computer or on a typewriter. Do not write the contract by hand, as this is not accepted anymore since 2020.
