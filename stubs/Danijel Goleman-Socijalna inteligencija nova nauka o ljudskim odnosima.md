Socijalna inteligencija (social intelligence) is the ability to understand and manage our own emotions and those of others, as well as to navigate complex social situations with empathy, cooperation and influence. Goleman argues that socijalna inteligencija is not a fixed trait that we are born with, but a skill that can be learned and improved through practice and feedback. He also claims that socijalna inteligencija is more important than ever in the modern world, where we are constantly exposed to diverse and often conflicting perspectives, values and cultures.
 
Goleman draws on the latest findings from neuroscience, psychology, sociology and biology to explain how socijalna inteligencija works in the brain and body, and how it affects various aspects of our lives. He covers topics such as:
 
- How our brains are wired for social connection and communication
- How our emotions are contagious and can influence others' moods and behaviors
- How empathy and compassion can help us build trust and rapport with others
- How we can develop emotional self-awareness and self-regulation to cope with stress and negative emotions
- How we can enhance our social skills and competencies to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, persuade others and lead teams
- How we can foster positive social norms and values in our families, communities and organizations
- How we can use socijalna inteligencija to promote social justice, human rights and global citizenship

Goleman's book is a comprehensive and engaging guide to socijalna inteligencija, full of practical examples, anecdotes and exercises. It is suitable for anyone who wants to improve their social awareness, emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. It is also a valuable resource for educators, counselors, managers, leaders and anyone who works with people.

In this section, we will review some of the key concepts and insights from Goleman's book on socijalna inteligencija.
 
## The Two Brains: Social and Emotional
 
Goleman begins his book by introducing the idea of the two brains: the social brain and the emotional brain. The social brain is the part of our brain that enables us to communicate, cooperate and empathize with others. It consists of several neural circuits that are specialized for different aspects of social cognition and behavior, such as:

- The mirror neuron system, which allows us to imitate and learn from others' actions and expressions
- The theory of mind network, which allows us to infer and predict others' mental states and intentions
- The empathy circuit, which allows us to share and understand others' emotions and feelings
- The social reward system, which motivates us to seek and maintain social bonds and affiliations

The emotional brain is the part of our brain that regulates our emotions and moods. It consists of several structures that are involved in generating, processing and modulating emotional responses, such as:

- The amygdala, which triggers the fight-or-flight response and alerts us to potential threats and dangers
- The hippocampus, which stores and retrieves emotional memories and associations
- The insula, which monitors our internal bodily states and sensations
- The prefrontal cortex, which controls our impulses, plans our actions and evaluates our outcomes

Goleman argues that both the social brain and the emotional brain are essential for socijalna inteligencija. They work together to help us navigate complex social situations with flexibility, adaptability and creativity. However, they can also conflict with each other when we face stress, uncertainty or ambiguity. For example, when we are angry or afraid, our emotional brain can hijack our rational thinking and impair our social judgment. Conversely, when we are socially isolated or rejected, our social brain can trigger negative emotions and lower our self-esteem.
 
Therefore, Goleman suggests that we need to balance and integrate our two brains to achieve optimal socijalna inteligencija. He proposes four domains of socijalna inteligencija that reflect this integration: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management.
